Please generate content for a DSE speaking paper that will be inserted into an HTML template with the following structure:

- The content should be divided into two main sections:

  1. PART A (Group Interaction)
  2. PART B (Individual Response)

- Format each section with its header using markdown:

  ## PART A &nbsp;&nbsp; Group Interaction

  [content for part A]

  ## PART A &nbsp;&nbsp; Group Interaction

  [content for part B]

- For Part A:

  - Include a blockquote for the article/magazine content with a short title
  - The content in the blockquote should be fluent and engaging.
  - Do not include sources at the end of the blockquote.
  - Include exactly 4 bullet points for discussion topics
  - The last bullet point should be "anything else you think is important"
  - The article should not be focusing on the number but instead focusing on the affect itself

- For Part B:
  - Include exactly 8 numbered questions for individual response
  - The questions should be open-ended and not leading
  - The scope of the questions should be within the reach of a 17 year old student.

The HTML template will extract these sections based on the headers, so proper formatting is essential.
