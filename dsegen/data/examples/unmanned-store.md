> ### Family Mart's first "unmanned convenience store" in Japan
>
> _We paid a visit to a Tokyo convenience store where there's no human clerk to pay._
>
> On Thursday, Family Mart opened a new branch inside Tokyo Station. It has the sort of food and
> beverages you'd expect in a Japanese convenience store, but there aren't any employees at the check-out
> counters. That's because the payments are all done through a slick, unmanned system.
>
> One difference you'll notice right away is that there's a gate you pass through when entering the shop. As
> we stepped through, a recorded voice called out, "Trasshaimase!" ("Welcome!").
>
> The total selection of products isn't quite as wide as it is at some Family Marts, but customers can still get
> toiletries and face masks.
>
> There actually is one Family Mart employee on the premises, who only handles shelf-stocking and
> customer inquiries. When we walked up to the check-out counters with our purchases, no human cashier
> was present. We didn't even have to scan anything. The terminal already knew what we had in our hand to
> buy and it made an electronic beep to draw our attention to the screen, where the total amount to be paid
> was displayed. You can pay with an e-money card, credit card or cash.
>
> Oh, and by the way, there's also a gate you have to pass through in order to leave the store, and if you have
> an unpaid bill, it won't open up until you settle your account.
