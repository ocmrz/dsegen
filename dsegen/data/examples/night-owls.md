> ### Night Owls
>
> 'Night owls' are people who are naturally more awake and active at night
> and tend to go to bed late. Research has found that night owls face higher
> rates of poor health, including having a 10 percent higher risk of dying
> younger than 'early birds' or people who get up early and feel more
> energetic first thing in the day. Night owls often suffer from long-term lack
> of sleep and this can increase the chance of diabetes, heart disease and
> obesity. Not having enough sleep even for just one night can make us
> moody; when it happens every single night for an extended period,
> depression can develop.
>
> Associate professor Kristen Knutson at Northwestern University said: "This is a public health issue that
> cannot be ignored. We need to recognise that people have different body clocks which regulate the
> time we feel sleepy and wakeful throughout the day. Some people naturally wake up early while others
> feel more awake at night. All of this comes down to a combination of genes and the person's environment."

> Employers can benefit from adjusting start times to suit individual employees' needs. Another study
> found that when companies let night owls start work later in the day or allowed them to work from
> home, there was an estimated US$277m gain in productivity. It argues that people who are more awake at
> night should be allowed to start and finish work later. Not everyone is suited to get up for an 8am start.
